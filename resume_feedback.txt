🌱 OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH

   1. To significantly improve, focus on quantifying every achievement with concrete numbers, especially for senior roles. Elaborate on the impact and outcomes of your work rather than just describing tasks. Additionally, replace generic resume phrases with specific examples of your problem-solving skills and contributions, and clarify any overlapping employment periods for credibility.
   2. Consider adding more quantifiable metrics and specific outcomes in professional experience bullet points.
   3. Strengthen by adding evidence of senior-level impact, leadership, or architectural contributions for titled roles.
   4. Reduce use of templated, generic language and buzzwords in the summary and introductory sections.
   5. Unclear and potentially conflicting employment dates with overlapping full-time and intern positions.
   6. Listing multiple skills without providing explicit supporting evidence of their use in projects or roles.
   7. Numerous skill claims in the introductory sections and dedicated 'Skills' section lack explicit proof of application in the experience or project descriptions (e.g., Node.js, Grunt, Gulp, Bower, specific AWS services like EC2/S3/Lambda, C/C++, Python, Kotlin, Swift, Agile methodologies, JavaScript unit test frameworks, caching layers, proxies, OOP/Design Patterns proof).
