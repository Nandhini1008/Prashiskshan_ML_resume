To make your excellent experience even more impactful, focus on two key areas: first, ensure all dates, especially in your 'Clubs & Internships' section, are accurate and reflect current or past engagements to maintain credibility. Second, enhance your internship and club activity descriptions by using strong action verbs and quantifying the impact or results of your contributions whenever possible to highlight your value.",

          "reason": "Human Reviewer: Statements like 'Demonstrated leadership', 'Strong leadership & team collaboration', 'Effective communicator', or 'Gained experience in teamwork' are subjective and lack objective evidence.

          "reason": "Human Reviewer: Strict human reviewers prioritize measurable results and the underlying purpose/problem a project solved. Without these, projects appear as academic exercises or tasks completed, rather than valuable contributions with tangible benefits. 'Measurable impact' is claimed but not proven."

Provide context for what was built or implemented. | Example: TECHNICAL ASSOCIATE (DEVS CLUB REC): Engineered a Python-based text recognition tool using OpenCV and Tesseract to automate data extraction from event sign-up sheets, improving data processing speed by 40% and reducing manual errors by 25%.",
